      "So, by year 2243 at the current human plant consumption rate and compound population growth rate, we would consume all the global NPP with a total population of ~793 billion individuals. With the linear growth model, it would take us 8318 years (year 10,301) which is much more optimistic. I might go with the more optimistic estimate, as population growth has been reported to slow down globally and seems unlikely that humans will consume all of the NPP in the near future. "

      "Again we are short of the 5% mark, but 2% consumption is quite a bit considering that would be equivalent to consuming half of the African rainforest. In the Vitousek et al. (1986) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/1310258> paper of human appropriation of products of photosynthesis, they use a much larger estimate of global NPP (roughly 224.5 Pg(C)), but also assume that there are 5e9 people, with 2500 kcal diets, and 33% of their protein derive from animal material. Furthermore, they assume water content is roughly 20% rather than our 70% estimate. They come to a final low end estimate for direct human use of plants as cited:\n",

The losses raise the calculated potential NPP of terrestrial ecosystems to 149.6 Pg (132.1 + 17.5 here). Thus, humans now appropriate nearly 40% (58.1/149.6 Pg = 38.8%) of potential terrestrial productivity, or 25% [60.1/(149.8 + 92.4) Pg =  24.8%] of the potential global terrestrialand aquatic NPP. If we use Olson et al.'s base and leave out losses of NPP from converting land to cropland, estimated human appropriation of NPP on land rises to 62.7 Pg, **or about 41% (62.7/152.4 = 41.4%) of potential terrestrial NPP**. Furthermore, humans also affect much of the other 60% of terrestrial NPP, often heavily._\n",
