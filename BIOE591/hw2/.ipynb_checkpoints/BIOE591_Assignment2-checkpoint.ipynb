      "*Exercise 1: Suppose that the average residence time (ignoring respiratory pathways) of carbon in the phytoplankton in a lake is two weeks. Zooplankton in the lake, grazing upon the phytoplankton, consume 40% of the net primary productivity and have an incorporation efficiency of 25% (i.e., 25% of the phytoplankton biomass they eat is incorporated into zooplankton biomass). In other words, the net productivity of the zooplankton is 0.25 x 0.40 or 10% of the npp of the algae. If the average residence time (ignoring respiratory pathways) of carbon in zooplankton biomass is six months, estimate the ratio of the average biomass of the zooplankton population to that of the phytoplankton population in the lake. Figure II-3 illustrates the flows in and out of the two stocks of plankton.*"
