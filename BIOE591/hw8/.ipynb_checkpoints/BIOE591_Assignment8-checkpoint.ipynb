      "##Exercise 4: \n",
      "The \"nuclear winter\" phenomenon arises becase of the large quantities of soot that would get lofted into the upper troposphere in the aftermath of nuclear war. The soot, resulting from widespread fires caused by detonating nuclear bombs, would block the solar flux and cause a darkening and freezing at Earth's surface. Absorption of sunlight by the soot would warm the upper atmosphere. To explore this phenomenon (or that of a major volcanic eruption or asteroid impact causing alteration of sunlight at Earth's surface) in our model, make the following assumptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "   1. Of the incident nonreflected solar flux, 95% is absorbed in the upper zone of the atmosphere (because that is where the soot is).\n",
      "   2. Of the remaining 5%, half is absorbed in the lower zone of the atmosphere and half at Earth's surface.\n",
      "   3. Earth's albedo is unchanged, but $F_w$ = 0.\n",
      "   4. $F_e$ will be reduced by 50% (because the driving force behind vertical convection - a surface that is warmer than the air aloft - will be eliminated). \n",
      "   5. The soot is a poor absorber of IR, so n is still equal to 2. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are $T_s$, $T_1$, and $T_0$ in the steady state under these conditions? In reality, a steady-state nuclear winter would not set in because soot would gradually settle out of the atmosphere, after which the surface of Earth would warm up. This exercise also ignores the fact that reflective dust would be lofted into the stratosphere as a result of the detonations. The actual percentage of sunlight absorbed by the soot and reflected by the dust would depend on the number, size, and target sites of the detonated bombs. Should nuclear war erupt today, given the present nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union, the value for sunlight absorption used here is not at all implausible. \n"
